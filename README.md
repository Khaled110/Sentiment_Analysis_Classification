## Introduction
The main objective of this project is to address the problem of homonyms in sentiment analysis. 
Homonyms are words that have the same spelling or pronunciation (or having mostly similar words) but 
different meanings, which can lead to ambiguity and affect the accuracy of sentiment analysis models. 
The project aims to develop a pipeline that can handle homonyms in sentiment analysis tasks by 
considering contextual information.
